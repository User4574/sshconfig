h1. SSHConfig

This is a gem which allows you to programatically configure your ~/.ssh/config.

It's a bit bad, but it works.

h2. Config file

Your new file to worry about is ~/.ssh/sshconfig.

h2. ssh-update-config

The @ssh-update-config@ command will generate the ~/.ssh/config file for you. The file will be overwritten.

h2. Directives

In the block you pass to a host method, any method becomes an sshconfig directive. It's method_missing_madness!

h2. It's all ruby!

h3. So write ruby!

Methods, loops, variables; you name it.

h3. $hostlist variable

The grand list of hosts is stored in @$hostlist@. It's a @Hosts@ object. You can touch this. The @hosts {}@ method appends to this list. @$hostlist.host{}@ does the same as @hosts{host{}}@.

h2. Building

bc.   gem build sshconfig.gemspec
  gem install --user-install sshconfig

h2. Example

There's an example file, take a look.
